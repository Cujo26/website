Hey there!

My name is Cujo, I build, modify, and talk constantly about keyboards.

This website primarily serves as my personal contact page to get in touch for any of my keyboard services.
I may at some point decide to start writing guides here, however, for now this will just be a static page serving some links.

Services I currently offer are as follows:

* Keyboard building
    * This service is currently free for most boards

* Switch modding
    * Lubrication (Krytox 205g0 on housing, Krytox 105 on housings, unless otherwise requested)
    * Filming (provided films are available)
    * Jailhouse mods for MX Blues
    * Assorted other mods on request, feel free to get in touch if you've seen anything interesting you'd like me to do to your switches

Note: Switch modding services are charged **per switch**

* Stabiliser modding
    * Wire balancing
    * Lubrication (Krytox 205g0 on housings and wires)

* Case mods
    * Foam
    * Silicone pours coming soon!
    * Other mods available on request, depending on the case provided

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:contact@cujo26.xyz) and I'll be happy to provide you with a quote.
**All mods and builds are performed _on stream_ unless requested otherwise**
